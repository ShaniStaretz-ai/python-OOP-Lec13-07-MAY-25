Object-Oriented Programming -Into
* 3 core principles of what is OOP:
  * class= define the pattern(blueprint) of the instance
  * object (entity) = created instance of the class
  * encapsulation (הסתרה, הכמסה)= public/protected/private
  * inheritance= mechanism that allows one class (called a subclass or child class)
  * polymorphism= the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways.
  to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and fields) of another class (called a superclass or parent class).
* SOLID =SOLID is sort for five design principles that help to design maintainable,scalable, and robust OO systems. 
These principles aim to reduce tight coupling, improve code organization,
and promote best practices in OOP. 
  * S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  * O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  * L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  * I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  * D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Methods= functions that describe the behaviors of the object
* Attributes (data)= properties definitions represent the state of the object
